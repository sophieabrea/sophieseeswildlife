We did this hike at the beginning of August, and while this 13,000’ doozy was definitely a challenging hike, the opportunity to see these silly rodents was well worth it.\n\n\n\nYellow-Bellied Marmots\n\n\n\n\n\nYellow Bellied Marmots\n\n\nSome other photos from Mt. Dana (who we now affectionately refer to as “our girl”). You get really personal after 5.4 miles and a 3000’ elevation gain!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the peak of Mt. Dana! You can see the beautiful Mono Lake back there too."

    "text": "To the herpetologists of the world, I am really hoping I IDed this lizard correctly. I have not encountered many reptiles while out in nature, or at least not long enough to get a good photo. But to the best of my knowledge, we encountered this Common Side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana) while walking along the path at Dante’s View in Death Valley.\n\n\n\nCommon Side-blotched lizard\n\n\n\n\n\nA little bit of eye-contact??\n\n\nDante’s View right before sunset was breathtaking. This was my second year visiting Death Valley but our first time checking out this viewpoint. Hopefully we come back next year!\n\n\n\nOverlooking Dante’s View with my fun hat\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Valley National Park with my lovely friends"

    "section": "",
    "text": "If you have never ventured up to Tomales Point or the Point Reyes area in general, I would recommend fixing that. This shoreline took my breath away the first time I saw it, and it still does after dozens of visits. My favorite hike in the area is the 9.6 mile Tomales Point Trail, namely because its right in the middle of a Tule Elk Reserve. You are basically guaranteed to encounter a ton of elk on this hike, and hey, they might even get pretty close!\n\n\n\nSome intense eye-contact with this guy\n\n\nAnd the view of these elk with the never ending Pacific behind them? You really cannot beat it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome beautiful videos of the elk. In this first one, I was nerding out over the fact that I recognized some of their communication methods from my EVE class (Flehman responses), but I unfortunately did not capture that on video.\n\n\n\n\nI did get some video of some proximity signals between these two male elk, who got quite aggressive with each other.\n\n\n\n\nWe also saw a plethora of birds on our hike and throughout the day. My favorite of the day was the Belted Kingfisher that we spotted on the drive up, but I only got a picture of this California Scrub Jay. Still awesome though!! And I felt like a boss when I actually had an answer for a passing hiker who asked me what type of bird it was (not really a flex to ID a California Scrub Jay, but still!).\n\n\n\nCalifornia Scrub Jay atop a rock"
