    "text": "To the herpetologists of the world, I am really hoping I IDed this lizard correctly. I have not encountered many reptiles while out in nature, or at least not long enough to get a good photo. But to the best of my knowledge, we encountered this Common Side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana) while walking along the path at Dante’s View in Death Valley.\n\n\n\nCommon Side-blotched lizard\n\n\n\n\n\nA little bit of eye-contact??\n\n\nDante’s View right before sunset was breathtaking. This was my second year visiting Death Valley but our first time checking out this viewpoint. Hopefully we come back next year!\n\n\n\nOverlooking Dante’s View with my fun hat\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Valley National Park with my lovely friends"
