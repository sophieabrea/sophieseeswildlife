Ran into a bunch of beautiful Yellow-Bellied marmots while hiking up to Mt. Dana! We did this hike at the beginning of August, and while this 13,000' doozy was definitely a challenging hike, the opportunity to see these silly rodents was well worth it.

Some other photos from Mt. Dana (who we now affectionately refer to as "our girl"). You get really personal after 5.4 miles and a 3000' elevation gain!
