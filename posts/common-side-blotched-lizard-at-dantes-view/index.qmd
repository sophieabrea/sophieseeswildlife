To the herpetologists of the world, I am really hoping I IDed this lizard correctly. I have not encountered many reptiles while out in nature, or at least not long enough to get a good photo. But to the best of my knowledge, we encountered this Common Side-blotched lizard *(Uta stansburiana)* while walking along the path at Dante's View in Death Valley.

Dante's View right before sunset was breathtaking. This was my second year visiting Death Valley but our first time checking out this viewpoint. Hopefully we come back next year!
