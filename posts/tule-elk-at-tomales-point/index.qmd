If you have never ventured up to Tomales Point or the Point Reyes area in general, I would recommend fixing that. This shoreline took my breath away the first time I saw it, and it still does after dozens of visits. My favorite hike in the area is the 9.6 mile Tomales Point Trail, namely because its right in the middle of a Tule Elk Reserve. You are basically guaranteed to encounter a ton of elk on this hike, and hey, they might even get pretty close!

And the view of these elk with the never ending Pacific behind them? You really cannot beat it.

Some beautiful videos of the elk. In this first one, I was nerding out over the fact that I recognized some of their communication methods from my EVE class (Flehman responses), but I unfortunately did not capture that on video.

I did get some video of some proximity signals between these two male elk, who got quite aggressive with each other.

We also saw a plethora of birds on our hike and throughout the day. My favorite of the day was the Belted Kingfisher that we spotted on the drive up, but I only got a picture of this California Scrub Jay. Still awesome though!! And I felt like a boss when I actually had an answer for a passing hiker who asked me what type of bird it was (not really a flex to ID a California Scrub Jay, but still!).
